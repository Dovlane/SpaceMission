# SpaceMission

## About

SpaceMission was project on RAF (Računarski fakultet - Computer science faculty) that demonstrated usage of Java and connection with a server with JDBC library. SpaceMission is representing a database for travel and exploration of the planets and satelites.


## Description

Planet or satellite in order to be habitable, the following criteria need to be met:<br/>
• The average distance of the planet/satellite from the nearest star should be between 100 and 200 million kilometers<br/>.
• The lowest recorded temperature on the planet/satellite should be between 150 and 250 Kelvin, and the highest between 250 and 350 Kelvin, while the difference between the lowest and highest recorded temperature must not exceed 120 Kelvin.<br/>
• The atmosphere must contain between 15% and 25% oxygen, but there must also be another gas in which oxygen is soluble and which is not harmful to humans. Together, this gas and oxygen must constitute between 90% and 99% of the atmosphere.<br/>
• The planet/satellite must be large enough to support its own gravitational field up to at least 1000 km in height (only the maximum height at which the gravitational field is supported is recorded).<br/>
• The orbital speed around the nearest star should be between 25 and 35 km/s.<br/>

These conditions are checked with SQL instructions.
